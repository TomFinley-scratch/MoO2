Planet descriptions seem to be from 0x162E9 to 0x1684E (length varies)...

Block 0 and 1 indicate the colony number...
Block 2 indicates star system
Block 3 indicates position in star system (0 throgh 4)
THESE MUST MATCH INDICES IN THE STAR SYSTEM PORTION OF FILE
Block 4 indicates type of body (1 asteroid, 2 gas giant, 3 planet)
Block 5 seems to control size (0 tiny, 4 huge)
Block 6 seems to control gravity (0 low, 1 med, 2 high)
Block 7 UNKNOWN, seems to always be 0,1,2,3... always 0 on "constructed" planets?
Block 8 seems to control type of planet
	(0 toxic, 1 radiated, 2 barren, 3 desert, 4 tundra,
	5 ocean, 6 swamp, 7 arid, 8 terran, 9 gaia)
Block 9, controls planetary "scenery" graphic on colony view (0, 1, 2), seems randomly assigned
Block A seems to control richness... (00 is ultra poor, 04 is ultra rich)
Block B seems to control base farming of the planet
Block C, number of "terraforms" the planet has undergone (difficult to evaluate at present) (0 through 3)
Block D, related to size, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10 for tiny through huge... they are *ALMOST ALWAYS* but not always correlated to the size... what is this used for?  Why the exceptions?
Block E seems to indicate constructed planets... 0 for regular (all have these at first), 20 for constructed from asteroid, 25 for constructed from gas giant... hmmm, why note it?
Block F are some special attributes (00 nothing, 0A artifacts, 0B orion, 05 gem deposits, 04 gold deposits, 06 natives, 07 splinter colony)
Block G UNKNOWN, but always 0 at first, in late game seems to be 2 on well developed worlds: contemplation, indicates presence or absence of weather control?... should check

1010 artifacts...
1011 orion...
0101 gem...
0100 gold...
0110 natives...
0111 splinter...

-------------

Within stars themselves...

Block 15-16 is the X-coordinate (from the left)
Block 17-18 is the Y-coordinate (from the top)
Block 19 is the size of the star (0=big, 1=med, 2=small)
Block 20 seems *SOMEHOW* related to the owner... but it doesn't follow an easily interpretable scheme when there are multiple owners?
Block 22 is the color of the star (blue, white, yellow, orange, red, brown, blackhole)

-----------------

Colonies:

Start at 0x25d extend more or less up to the beginning of the planets.  (Curiously, there are 250 colony spots, but 360 spots for planets.)

0x169 length blocks, prior to the planets.  Prefixed when absent with 6 0xFF bytes.

Block 2 and 3 indicate planet number.
